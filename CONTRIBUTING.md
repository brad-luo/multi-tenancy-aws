## Getting Started

### Development Setup

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/multi-tenancy-aws.git
   cd multi-tenancy-aws
   ```

3. **Add the original repository as upstream**:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner/multi-tenancy-aws.git
   ```

4. **Create a branch** for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
   ```

5. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

6. **Set up environment variables**:

### Branch Naming Convention

Use descriptive branch names that follow this pattern:

- `feature/description` - for new features
- `fix/description` - for bug fixes
- `docs/description` - for documentation changes

## Development Process

### Making Changes

1. **Keep your fork updated**:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git checkout main
   git merge upstream/main
   ```

2. **Create a new branch** for your feature:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Make your changes** following our style guidelines

4. **Test your changes**:
   ```bash
   npm test
   npm run lint

```

**Types:**
- `feat`: A new feature

## Style Guidelines

### Code Style

We use ESLint and Prettier to enforce consistent code style:

# Check linting
npm run lint

# Fix linting issues
npm run lint -- --fix

# Format code
npm run format
```

### Key Guidelines

- **Use TypeScript** for all new code
- **Prefer functional components** with hooks
- **Use descriptive variable names**
- **Add JSDoc comments** for complex functions
- **Follow existing patterns** in the codebase
- **Keep functions small** and focused
- **Use meaningful commit messages**

### File Structure

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/          # React components
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ui/             # Reusable UI components
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ __tests__/      # Component tests

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/             # Configuration files
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ constants/          # Application constants
```

### React/Next.js Guidelines

- Use **Server Components** when possible
- Implement proper **error boundaries**
- Use **React.Suspense** for loading states
- Prefer **composition over inheritance**
- Use **custom hooks** for complex logic
- Implement **proper TypeScript types**

### CSS/Styling Guidelines

- Use **Tailwind CSS** classes
- Follow **mobile-first** responsive design
- Use **semantic HTML** elements
- Ensure **accessibility** compliance
- Test across **different browsers**

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test file
npm test -- components/FileManager.test.tsx
```

### Writing Tests

- **Write tests for new features**
- **Test edge cases and error conditions**
- **Use descriptive test names**
- **Group related tests with `describe` blocks**
- **Mock external dependencies**
- **Test user interactions, not implementation details**

### Test Structure

```typescript
describe('ComponentName', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Setup
  });

  it('should do something when condition is met', () => {
    // Arrange
    const props = { /* test props */ };
    
    // Act
    render(<ComponentName {...props} />);
    
    // Assert
    expect(screen.getByText('Expected text')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- **Document public APIs** with JSDoc
- **Add inline comments** for complex logic
- **Keep README.md** up to date
- **Document breaking changes**

### API Documentation

When adding new API endpoints:

1. **Document the endpoint** in the code
2. **Add request/response examples**
3. **Update API documentation**
4. **Include error responses**

### Examples

```typescript
/**
 * Creates a new workspace for the authenticated user
 * @param name - The workspace name (1-50 characters)
 * @param description - Optional workspace description
 * @param userId - The authenticated user's ID
 * @returns Promise<Workspace | null> - The created workspace or null if failed
 * @throws {Error} When workspace limit is exceeded
 */
export async function createWorkspace(
  name: string,
  userId: string,
  description?: string
): Promise<Workspace | null> {
  // Implementation
}
```
